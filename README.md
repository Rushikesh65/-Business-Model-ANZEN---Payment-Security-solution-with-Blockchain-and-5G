# Data-Analysis-Payment-Security-solution-with-Blockchain-and-5G
Blockchain solution to safeguard the payments you pay online using 5G and Edge computing
Proposed Solution and Details-

1.1.	Product Outline:
We are proposing a solution to secure online payments to avoid online payment frauds through 5G, Edge Computing and Blockchain. The solution will be built through the decentralized transfer of payment data.  
 
1.2.	Leveraging 5G & Edge:
The data will be decentralized in several edge systems and blocks of the chain. Blockchain-based authentication requires validation of all transactions through each decentralized block in the system. This causes latency in the execution of transactions which can be avoided by using 5G.
 
1.3.	Customers:
Our target customers are E-commerce companies having platforms that execute online payments on a large-scale basis. A study from Juniper Research has found that the value of losses due to eCommerce fraud will rise this year, from $17.5 billion in 2020 to over $20 billion by 2021; a growth of 18% over a single year.
  
1.4.	Value of Solution to Customer
•	A study from Juniper Research has found that the value of losses due to eCommerce fraud will rise this year, from $17.5 billion in 2020 to over $20 billion by 2021; a growth of 18% over a single year. Online sellers lost $130 billion to online payment fraud between 2018 and 2023.
•	It is estimated that more than 30% of frauds occur through Man-In-The-Middle (MITM) attacks.
•	Online payment fraud costs 1.8% of total revenue on average. The average gross profit margin in online retail is 40%, thus loss of profit is 0.72% (40% of 1.8) of total revenue. Given that Man-in-the-middle attacks account for 30% of total fraud, the loss of direct profit/money becomes 0.72*0.3 = 0.216% of total revenue. The total estimated E-commerce sales in 2021 were USD 871 billion. Thus, the total loss we are trying to save is at least = 0.216% of 870 = USD 1.88 billion per annum. 
•	Also, man-in-the-middle attacks lead to chargebacks on which E-commerce firms lose $2.94 on every $1 chargeback due to chargeback fees, merchandise distribution, fraud investigation, legal prosecution, and software security.
•	Besides all this, 81% of consumers say they would stop engaging with a brand online following a data breach. This accounts for additional customer lifetime value lost by E-commerce companies over and above the above-calculated costs. 


1.5.	Cost to customers
Customers should ideally be charged for each transaction protected. This charge should also depend on the amount of the transaction being made. This charge will also depend on AT&T’s fixed costs and operating costs for offering our solution to the market. Besides, it will also depend on the customer’s willingness to pay. A balance has to be achieved by analyzing the values calculated in cost-to-customers and the operational + fixed costs of AT&T.
 
1.6.	Value to AT&T
There are multiple benefits to AT&T
•	The indirect value which AT&T gets from this is enhanced security of its online payment processes.
•	Profits through selling this solution to customers.
•	Scope to enter the broader market by offering decentralized data storage services to protect companies' most valuable data assets like data of authentication credentials, credit cards, and other company-specific important data assets.

1.7.	Ecosystem & AT&T Partners
•	The network and scaling will be handled by AT&T itself and for the hard work and edge systems CISCO
•	Blockchain solution and deployment will be with service partners Amazon web services.
•	The payment gateway integration partners will be companies like visa, MasterCard, etc.,
•	Finally, the payment processing happens on the e-commerce with the payment gateways like Anzen, stripe, etc.,
